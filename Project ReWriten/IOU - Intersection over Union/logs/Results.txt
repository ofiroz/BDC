In a recognition test on 70 samples 14/70 was not recognize ==> 80% SUCCESS!

The "hard" images are:

26	32
28	34
29	35
33	39
46	50
51-55	55-59
61-63	64-66
65	68

Those samples will be removed - they are useless for the IOU calculation...

FYI
processing was not chronological - (s1, s2, s10) will be processed as (s1, s10, s2)
