Log files for 12 video samples - run for 15:44 minutes
=======================================================

Tested 2 upper body cascade with 143p and 390n.
	haar_cascade_upperbody_24x24_15it_90pos_1m34sec.xml
	haar_cascade_upperbody_24x24_20it_90pos_5m46sec.xml

Results were surprisingly good!
	head to the side was reconized
	eyes closed/ open was reconized

TODOs:
- remove from the dataset all side & back body position videos
- create features models for side and back positions
- add more pos samples with/ without pacifier (handel up/ down)
- resize min to 130*130 for better presission
